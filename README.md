Challenge part of the recruitment process at GoContact

## Usage

To run the application open a terminal instance and go to the /internal-api folder and run the command:
node index.js

While keeping the instance of the terminal open, open another instance of the terminal go inside the /client folder and run the command:
npm start

Now to see the application open your broswer (in my case chrome) and go to the following URL:
http://localhost:5000/

Keep both instances of the terminal running so the frontend application can talk to the backend
